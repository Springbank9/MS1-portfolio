## Design 

### Colour scheme
The site’s background includes images taken from the black face print series in order to animate the page. The images selected for the background have been chosen due to their simplicity and light hue. The background images’ opacity is also set to 0.65 in order to make the content/imagery the main focus of the site. 

### Typography 
The “Lato" font is the main font used throughout the site. Lato is a clean font and adds to the minimal aesthetic of the site. It is also an appropriate font for image labels and has been emphasised with italics and boldness within headings and captions. The text is kept at x-small in order to make the imagery the focus. 

### Imagery
The images are the main focus of the webiste. The carousel display within sections mimics a gallery so visitors can click through the individual artworks. Vertical scrolling is introduced on smaller devices, making the site responsive to mobile viewing and to make sure whole images are visible.
